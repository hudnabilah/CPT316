We have used Java for our programming language and implemented lexical analysis and syntax analysis in our programming code. The code tokenizes source code input, performs lexical analysis, and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree through parsing. We have also provided our report in PDF and MS-word in our folder.

# Overview

The 'Lexer.java' file contains the implementation of a lexer, which tokenizes source code input and performs lexical analysis. The 'Parser.java' file contains the implementation of a parser that builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens generated by the lexer.

# Guidelines

## Lexer
1. Ensure the source code starts and ends with curly brackets: '{}'.
2. Enter the source code when prompted.
3. To enter another source code, type 'yes'. To terminate the program, type 'no'.

## Parser
1. Ensure you have used the lexer to obtain a list of tokens.
2. Instantiate the 'Parser' class with the list of tokens.
3. Call the 'parse()' method to build the AST.

# Rules

We have implemented the following rules in our code:
1. Rule 1: Source code must start with '{' and end with '}'.
2. Rule 2: Source code cannot have illegal characters.
3. Rule 3: Operators must be used between two identifiers.
4. Rule 4: Consecutive tokens of the same type (except separators) are not allowed.
5. Rule 5: Literals/Constants can be only used in assignment and return operations.
6. Rule 6: Semicolon is required at the end before the closing curly brace '}'.
7. Rule 7: Curly brackets, parentheses, braces, and brackets must be in pairs.

If any of these rules are violated, you will be prompted to input 'yes' or 'no' if you want to write another source code.
